# project-2
This project was done for my Intro into Web Design and Multimedia class taken in the Spring of 2025. This code created a single webpage that contains some basic info about me, including some of my favorite things, and the schedule I kept during the Spring Semester. This was the start of me learning how to work with the HTML and CSS languages.
